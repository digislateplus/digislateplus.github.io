# DigiSlate+

DigiSlate+ is based on the [DigiSlate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnaWQZtmPek) and is inspired by the DIY timecode generator from [mitkunz](https://github.com/mitkunz/diy_timecode_generator). The aim for the DigiSlate+ is not only to be able to read and display timecode, but also to generate it itself. To make this possible, the hardware is extended by a real time clock with high running accuracy. The RTC module DS3231 with temperature-compensated quartz offers the possibility.

There are two versions of the DigiSlate+. The simpler version is based on modified hardware from the original DigiSlate project and the software in the master branch.

The newly developed hardware offers significantly more functions. The corresponding code can be found in the dotmatrix branch.
