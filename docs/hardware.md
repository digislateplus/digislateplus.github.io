# Hardware

[Home](README.md)

The hardware is based on an ESP32S3 microcontroller, which supplies the time code, controls the displays and can connect to other devices via WiFi and Bluetooth.

All components are combined on a central circuit board, only the switch for recognising the flap, the main switch and the battery are connected via JST-XH connectors.

The 7-segment LED displays for the time code, scenes and take numbers are located on the front. The rear has the LC display, four buttons and a rotary encoder for controlling the functions.

The real-time clock has its own battery, which enables a long running time when the DigiSlate+ is switched off.

A 3.5mm jack is used for the input and output of the timecode. The DigiSlate+ can be powered via a 5.5x2.5mm DC plug. The DigiSlate can be supplied with a voltage between 8 volts and 24 volts via a 5.5 x 2.5 mm DC plug and the internal battery can be charged.
