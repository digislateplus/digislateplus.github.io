# Functions
## Start
The DigiSlate+ is put into operation using the switch on the bottom. After a short initialization, the time is read from the real-time clock. The time code is synchronized with the exact time base of the real-time clock and "init" is shown on the LC display.

Once initialization is complete, the time code starts running on the LED display. The LC display on the back shows "run" as well as the set frame rate and the user bits.

If the DigiSlate+ is operated, the sync LEDs flash and the time code display remains for three seconds. "clap" is shown on the LC display. After that, the time code continues to run again.

## Time code output
The time code is output at the tip of the 3.5 mm jack socket as an LTC with a voltage of 1 volt peak-to-peak.

## Time code input
An external time code can be fed in via the ring of the 3.5 mm jack socket.  The DigiSlate+ recognizes this and switches to reading mode. The read time code is shown on the LED display and the LC display shows "sync".

The time in the real-time clock is not changed. When the time code entry is finished, the DigiSlate+ goes back to "run" mode and shows the time of the real-time clock.

### Jam
The external time code can be transferred to the real-time clock.

1. Switch off the DigiSlate+

2. Feed the external time code via the 3.5mm jack socket
3. Switch on the DigiSlate+

It is in "jam" mode, which is shown on the LC display. The time code is transferred to the real-time clock as soon as it is folded once.

## Setup
Parameters of the DigiSlate+ can be set in the setup.

- Set time code
- Set user bits
- Select frame rate

### Start
The setup mode is started as follows.

1. Turn off the DigiSlate+
2. Turn on the DigiSlate+
3. When the text "tripple clap to enter setup" appears, quickly clap the DigiSlate+ three times.

"SETUP" will now appear on the LCD display.
