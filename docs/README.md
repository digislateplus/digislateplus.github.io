DigiSlate+ is based on the [DigiSlate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnaWQZtmPek) and is inspired by the DIY timecode generator from [mitkunz](https://github.com/mitkunz/diy_timecode_generator). The aim for the DigiSlate+ is not only to be able to read and display timecode, but also to generate it itself. To make this possible, the hardware is extended by a real time clock with high running accuracy. The RTC module DS3231 with temperature-compensated quartz offers a maximum drift of two minutes per year or 8 frames in a day.
